## About This Project

This is my personal portfolio website - basically where I show off my work and tell my story as a developer. I built it to be fast, clean, and actually enjoyable to browse through.

**What makes it special:**
- **Smooth animations** that don't get in your way
- **Works perfectly on your phone** (or any device really)
- **Lightning fast** - no waiting around for pages to load
- **My personality** shines through the design

I spent a lot of time making sure it feels personal and authentic, not just another generic portfolio template.

## What I Built It With

**Frontend Magic:**
- **Next.js 15** - The React framework that makes everything smooth
- **TypeScript** - Because I like my code bug-free
- **CSS Modules** - Clean, organized styling
- **Custom animations** - All coded by hand, no heavy libraries

**The Good Stuff:**
- Loads in under 2 seconds
- Looks great on everything from phones to ultrawide monitors  
- Actually accessible (screen readers work perfectly)
- SEO optimized so people can find my work

## Want to Run It Locally?

If you're curious about how it works or want to use it as inspiration:

```bash
# Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/xcress/veshant.in.git
cd veshant.in

# Install everything
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and you're good to go!

## The Journey

Building this portfolio was honestly one of the most fun projects I've worked on. I wanted something that really represented who I am as a developer - someone who cares about both the technical stuff and the human experience.

**Some things I'm particularly proud of:**
- The typing animation on the homepage (took me way longer than it should have!)
- How smooth everything feels on mobile
- The geometric patterns that follow your mouse
- Making it fast without sacrificing the visual appeal

## Let's Connect!
